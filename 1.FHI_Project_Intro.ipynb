    "[MIMIC-II](https://physionet.org/mimic2/mimic2_clinical_overview.shtml) is a freely available database of ICU patients. To access the full database (now migrated to [MIMIC-III](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635.pdf))  you must sign a data use agreement. However, there is a [demo data set](https://physionet.org/mimic2/demo/) based on 4000 deceased patients that can be used without signing any DUA [1].\n",

    "The data set is very rich and so is a good resource for exploring the varieties of clinical data\n",

    "Data incluces free text notes (nursing, radiology, discharg summaries, etc.), input/output events, test results, procedure codes, diagnosis codes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 How did we prepare this dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Retrieved all the MD notes**    \n",
    "    Because the family history is usually recorded by doctors. We want to find more *positive mentions of the target concepts* when creating this dataset. Why?   \n",
    "    In this dataset, there are only two types of physician notes: 'discharge summary' and 'MD notes.' The latter only has a few and doesn't have any family history mentions. So we only retrieve discharge summaries.  \n",
    "    More details of how to, can be found [Retrieve the notes from MIMIC db](advanced/Retrieve the notes from MIMIC db.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Further narrowed down the notes**    \n",
    "    Used text search to identify notes that have relevant phrases like *'breast cancer', 'colon cancer', etc. (needs to be rich and complete).   \n",
    "    \n",
    "3) **Randomly pulled notes from the rest as negative samples**    \n",
    "    Manually went over the notes to make sure that there are no mentions of our interest.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4) **Preprocessed the documents**  \n",
    "    Replaced the PHI markups with mimic real information. For example, replaced '[\\*\\* Known patient lastname \\*\\*]' in an original document with a random name 'Adams'.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "5) **Annotated the dataset**    \n",
    "    Annotated the dataset using [Brat](http://brat.nlplab.org/).\n",
    "    \n",
    "6) **Packaged up**    \n",
    "    Splitted the dataset through group sampling into training (60%) and testing (40%). Zipped them into two zip files. More details of how to do it, can be found [SplitDataset.ipynb](advanced/SplitDataset.ipynb)\n",

An R IJ line was <br/>attempted to be inserted at this time, but caused a hematoma. Pt <br/>was still hypotensive so a left SC line was put in and caused a <br/>second hematoma. She was started on dopamine in the ER and then <br/>changed to levophed b/c she got tachycardic. An EKG showed ST <br/>elevations in leads I, II AVR and V2-V6. Pt was taken to cath <br/>emergently d/t ST changes and hypotension thought to be from <br/>cardiogenic shock.  <br/>The cath showed:  <br/>LMCA, LCX: no significant disease  <br/>LAD: mild diffuse irregularirties  <br/>RCA: 50-60% ostial with catheter damping  <br/>LV: LVEF 20% with apical ballooning  <br/>--moderately elevated left sided and severely elevated right <br/>sided filling pressures; severe pulm htn, severely depressed CO, <br/>apical ballooning syndrom vs acute myocarditis.  <br/>co 2.6  ci 1.5  <br/>MAPs: RA 19 MD Number 12487 22 AO 64  <br/>An echo was done during the cath that showed no evidence of a <br/>pericardial effusion.  <br/>A balloon pump was also placed at the time of cath. Her groin <br/>was oozing at the cath site. Pt was given protamine to reverse <br/>the heparin. It was decided to hold her heparin drip until the <br/>AM and then start at a low dose b/c of hematomas and bleeding. <br/>It was thought that the patient had Takotsubo cardiomyopathy <br/>secondary to the stress of watching the news related to <br/>terrorist activity in Grand Rapids. ASA, plavix and beta-blocers were <br/>not started because the patient had clean coronaries. One day  <br/>after admission the balloon pump was pulled. An echo was done <br/>two days after admission and showed mild symmetric left <br/>ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function. <br/>Right ventricular free wall hypokinesis c/w possible ischemia <br/>(given normal PA systolic pressure). Mild aortic regurgitation.<br/>  Pt's CXR at admission showed possible ARDS, pneumonia or <br/>pulmonary edema. Pt could have had fluid overload in lungs <br/>secondary to systolic dysfuction. May also have had PNA, <br/>especially since WBC was elevated. Pt did not have fevers, <br/>however.  There was also a h/o pulmonary fibrosis, breast and <br/>lung cancer. She received captopril 6.5 mg to diurese pt and <br/>help her CHF. She was also given ipratropium inhalers.  One day <br/>after admission the family indicated to the social worker that <br/>the patient had been dc'd to home hospice care two weeks prior <br/>but the patient refused hospice and did not fill her narctoics <br/>for pain.  A palliative care consult was obtained.  Patient was <br/>still intubated but her respiratory status was not improving to <br/>a great degree.  Patient and patient's family made the decision <br/>to extubate the patient knowing that she would most likely die <br/>when extubated.  This was per the family consistent with the <br/>patient's previous expressed wishes. Of note patient's hct <br/>dropped from 43 at admission to 23 on 7-7.  Family was informed <br/>of the necessity of a transfusion but refused blood <br/>transfusions. The patient was made comfort measures only and <br/>extubated with family present consistent with the wishes of all. <br/> The patient was extubated on 1970-7-7.  She was pronounced dead <br/>at 7:0 pm on 1970-7-7 with the family at her side.  Family <br/>declined to have an autospys performed.<br/><br/>Acute blood loss anemia: Pt's hct has dropped significantly in <br/>the past day. This can be explained by two hematomas and oozing <br/>from the cath. It is possible that she is bleeding from <br/>somewhere else.  <br/>-will re-check hct in pm to see if pt stable  <br/>-check stool guiacs  <br/>.  <br/> <br/>Medications on Admission:<br/>MEDS: unknown, may include diovan <br/> <br/>Discharge Medications:<br/>patient expired<br/> <br/>Discharge Disposition:<br/>Expired<br/> <br/>Discharge Diagnosis:<br/>patient expired<br/> <br/>Discharge Condition:<br/>patient expired<br/> <br/>Discharge Instructions:<br/>patient expired<br/> <br/>Followup Instructions:<br/>patient expired<br/> <br/>                             Ixel Innis MD MD Number 353<br/> <br/>Completed by: Mylinh Karas Derrike Krawietz MD MD Number 10155 1970-10-14 @ 1827<br/>Signed electronically by: DR.

The cough persisted and he was given<br/>erythromycin times ten days times two courses by his primary<br/>care physician, Vandeest. Sorteberg.  The erythromycin did not improve<br/>the patient's symptoms.<br/><br/>The patient describes the cough as dry, not worse at night,<br/>breath.  He denied fevers and  chills.  He states that he<br/>lost about six pounds over the past two months intentionally.<br/>Over the past one to two weeks, however, he has noted<br/>increasing dyspnea with stairs, as well as fatigue.  On the<br/>day prior to admission, he started a Z pack.<br/><br/>At his primary care physician's office today, he had a chest<br/>x-ray which disclosed an enlarged heart and interstitial<br/>infiltrates.  An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done, as well<br/>as an echocardiogram which disclosed evidence of a<br/>pericardial effusion with tamponade.<br/><br/>There was diastolic collapse of the right atrium and right<br/>ventricle.  The patient was sent to the Emergency Department<br/>at Mission Community Hospital for evaluation of the<br/>pericardial effusion and drainage.  His pulses paradoxes was<br/>18.

Pulse 86.<br/>Blood pressure 124/63.  Respiratory rate 23.  Oxygen<br/>saturation 95% on three liters nasal cannula.  General:<br/>Elderly white male in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes,<br/>ears, nose and throat:  Anicteric, oropharynx clear, pupils<br/>equal, round and reactive to light, extraocular movements<br/>intact.  Neck:  Supple, no carotid bruit, no jugular venous<br/>distention.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, soft<br/>S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops, pericardial drain in<br/>place.  Chest clear to auscultation anteriorly, left lateral<br/>chest scar.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended with<br/>positive bowel sounds.  Extremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing<br/>or edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally.<br/>Neurological:  Cranial nerves II through XII are intact.<br/>Alert and oriented times three.  Exam otherwise nonfocal.<br/>Note:  This physical examination was done after the patient<br/>underwent his cardiac catheterization.<br/><br/>LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 7.3,<br/>hematocrit of 41, platelet count of 294,000.  PT 13, PTT<br/>23.6, INR 1.1.  Echocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm, 71<br/>beats per minute, electrical alternans, low voltage<br/>precordial leads, prolonged PR.  After the procedure,<br/>esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a sinus rhythm at 82 beats<br/>per minute, normal axis, prolonged PR, T wave inversions I<br/>and aVL, biphasic T in V2, Qs in V1 to V2, increased voltage.<br/><br/>HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted initially to the<br/>Coronary Care Unit.  He underwent a cardiac catheterization<br/>on 10-9 for pericardiocentesis.  Hemodynamics showed<br/>elevated and equal RA and pericardial pressures, 11-12 mm<br/>mercury, slightly lower than pulmonary capillary wedge<br/>pressure.  There was preserved cardiac index.  There is<br/>preserved blood pressure with 15-20 mm mercury pulses<br/>paradoxes.  During the pericardiocentesis, 1116 ml of<br/>serosanguinous fluid was easily removed. Fluid was sent to<br/>the laboratory for analysis.<br/><br/>Following the pericardiocentesis, the patient was admitted to<br/>the Coronary Care Unit for further management.  On 10-10, the pericardial drain was removed.  Repeat echocardiogram<br/>dMD Number 719 disclose recurrence of the pericardial effusion.<br/>Patient underwent CT of the chest which disclosed diffuse<br/>interstitial infiltrates consistent with lymphangitic spread.<br/>There was also a positive mediastinal lymphadenopathy and<br/>lytic sclerotic bone lesions.<br/><br/>On 10-12, the patient was transferred to the Citrus Heights<br/>Service.  On the night of the 16th, he was tachycardic to the<br/>160s.  Echocardiogram disclosed atrial flutter.  His blood<br/>pressure was stable.  He was started on sotalol 120 mg b.i.d.<br/>The following day this was decreased to 80 mg b.i.d.  While<br/>on sotalol, his QTC interval was monitored and his potassium<br/>was kept between 4.5 and 5.2.  Repeat echocardiogram dMD Number 719<br/>disclose re-accumulation of the pericardial effusion.<br/><br/>While on the Glendale Service.  A Pulmonary Consult was<br/>obtained for further evaluation of the diffuse infiltrates<br/>seen on the CT.  Pulmonary Service recommended awaiting the<br/>final pathology from the pericardial fluid.  They were<br/>willing to perform transbronchial biopsy if necessary.<br/><br/>Patient was also seen by his Oncologist, Dr. Maslinski.  Patient<br/>underwent an MRI of his brain on 10-16.  MRI disclosed<br/>foci on the surface of the brain that appeared consistent<br/>with leptomeningeal spread of cancer.  An abdominal CT was<br/>done on 10-16.  CT of the abdomen disclosed one<br/>lymphangitic spread of metastatic disease throughout the<br/>lungs was stable since the study one week before.  There was<br/>an increase in the pericardial fluid since the study one week<br/>prior.  There was interval development of multiple sclerotic<br/>and lytic lesions within the osseous structures since 1988.<br/>There were stable hepatic lesions that likely represent<br/>simple cysts. There was a stable splenic lesion that likely<br/>represents a hemangioma.  Although, colon appeared grossly<br/>normal, radiologist's caution that the study was not<br/>diagnostic for colon cancer.<br/><br/>Finally, pathology results from pericardial fluid were<br/>obtained.  Pathologists performed multiple stains to identify<br/>the type of cancer, the types of cells in the pericardial<br/>fluid.  Pathologist's concluded that the malignant cells were<br/>from adenocarcinoma.  The tumor cells are positive for CK7<br/>and TTF1 markers.  TTF1 marker is specific for lung and<br/>thyroid.  The cells were focally positive for CK20.<br/>Pathologist's concluded that this immunoprofile is consistent<br/>with an adenocarcinoma arising in the lung.<br/><br/>The patient was discharged on 10-17.  He will have<br/>outpatient work-up of his malignancy.<br/><br/>DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.<br/><br/>DISCHARGE STATUS:  Patient discharged home on Monday,<br/>1990-10-21.<br/><br/>DISCHARGE FOLLOW-UP:  He will follow-up with his Oncologist,<br/>Dr. Schons, at 2 p.m.  He will be seen by Dr. Parkey in the<br/>Brain Tumor Clinic at 4 p.m. on 1990-10-21.  He will<br/>follow-up with his Cardiologist, Dr. Patellis, on Wednesday,<br/>1990-10-23.  He was encouraged to call his primary<br/>care physician for KC Sciaraffa appointment.  Patient was<br/>given JH Bayers of Heart's monitor so that his QTC interval<br/>could be monitored for an additional week while on sotalol.<br/><br/>DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:<br/>1.  Pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade.<br/>2.  Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.<br/>3.  Hypertension.<br/>4. Atrial Fibrillation.<br/><br/>DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:<br/>1.
