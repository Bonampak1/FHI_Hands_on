    "## 1. Introduction of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "[MIMIC-II](https://physionet.org/mimic2/mimic2_clinical_overview.shtml) is a freely available database of ICU patients. To access the full database (now migrated to [MIMIC-III](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201635.pdf))  you must sign a data use agreement. However, there is a [demo data set](https://physionet.org/mimic2/demo/) based on 4000 deceased patients that can be used without signing any DUA [1].\n",

    "### 1.2 The Varieties of...Data\n",
    "The data set is very rich and so is a good resource for exploring the varieties of clinical data\n",
    "\n",
    "[database schemas at glance](https://mit-lcp.github.io/mimic-schema-spy/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data incluces free text notes (nursing, radiology, discharg summaries, etc.), input/output events, test results, procedure codes, diagnosis codes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 How did we prepare this dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Retrieved all the MD notes**    \n",
    "    Because the family history is usually recorded by doctors. We want to find more *positive mentions of the target concepts* when creating this dataset. Why?   \n",
    "    In this dataset, there are only two types of physician notes: 'discharge summary' and 'MD notes.' The latter only has a few and doesn't have any family history mentions. So we only retrieve discharge summaries.  \n",
    "    More details of how to, can be found [Retrieve the notes from MIMIC db](advanced/Retrieve the notes from MIMIC db.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Further narrowed down the notes**    \n",
    "    Used text search to identify notes that have relevant phrases like *'breast cancer', 'colon cancer', etc. (needs to be rich and complete).   \n",
    "    \n",
    "3) **Randomly pulled notes from the rest as negative samples**    \n",
    "    Manually went over the notes to make sure that there are no mentions of our interest.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4) **Preprocessed the documents**  \n",
    "    Replaced the PHI markups with mimic real information. For example, replaced '[\\*\\* Known patient lastname \\*\\*]' in an original document with a random name 'Adams'.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "5) **Annotated the dataset**    \n",
    "    Annotated the dataset using [Brat](http://brat.nlplab.org/).\n",
    "    \n",
    "6) **Packaged up**    \n",
    "    Splitted the dataset through group sampling into training (60%) and testing (40%). Zipped them into two zip files. More details of how to do it, can be found [SplitDataset.ipynb](advanced/SplitDataset.ipynb)\n",
